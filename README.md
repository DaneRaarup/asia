# asia

*Note:* This project is over. The information on this site may be outdated.

The old README.md file is below:



Website hosting work from Asia Unit

It'd be better if you checked it out! (head to jack-the-coder.github.io/asia/)

## Timeline

- The project is due at the end of March (actually Tuesday the 21st of March), so I will certainly have everything done by then.
- However, much of the website is completed at the time of this writing anyways, so it won't be long until the project is done.
- Project site warnings added by April
- README changes by May
- Project moved to "dustbin" in June, when school's out
