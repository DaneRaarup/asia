# asia
Website hosting work from Asia Unit

It'd be better if you checked it out! (head to jack-the-coder.github.io/asia/)

## Timeline

- The project is due at the end of March, so I will certainly have everything done by then.
- However, much of the website is completed at the time of this writing anyways, so it won't be long until the project is done.
- I may move it off of GitHub Pages if needed, however at the present it is preferred.
