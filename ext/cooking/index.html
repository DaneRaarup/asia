            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 19th, 2017</p>

            <p>I made an Asian dish at home and I will document the process that I used to make it and the reviews of those who had my meal here.  </p>
            <p>I made a chicken curry dish over rice and added snow peas on the side for veggies. </p>

            <p>Curry dishes are common in India, and it is thought that the seasoning originated there. </p>

            <img src="thumbnail000.png">
            <p>The very first step is to get the ingredients at the grocery store.</p>
            <img src="thumbnail002.png">
            <p>The next thing that I did was to dice the onion and garlic to make them easier to cook with. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail004.png">
            <img src="thumbnail005.png">
            <p>The chicken also needed to be cut up into bite-size pieces. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail006.png">
            <p>I seasoned the chicken, now cut up, with salt and pepper.  </p>
            <img src="thumbnail007.png">
            <p>We put a dash of olive oil and the curry powder into the pan and turned up the heat. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail011.png">
            <p>Once the oil had heated up a bit, the diced and seasoned chicken went into the pan. As soon as the chicken hit the pan, the entire house started smelling good!</p>
            <img src="thumbnail010.png">
            <p>Next, the cans had to be opened up to add them to the pan later on. We had bought coconut milk, diced tomatoes, and tomato sauce. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail012.png">
            <p>I added the onions and garlic to the chicken with a bit more oil. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail015.png">
            <p>We stirred together the chicken and the onions and decreased the heat a little. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail019.png">
            <p>Now it was time to add the canned ingredients. I started with the coconut milk, which came out chunky and needed some good stirring. The tomato-based ingredients went in more easily. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail020.png">
            <p>Very soon, the ingredients had dissolved and it began looking like a soup. We had an hour to wait before the dish would be ready, and so got started on the rice. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail021.png">
            <p>I put the cover on the pan while it simmered. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail024.png">
            <p>The rice, water, and some oil went into a pot on another burner. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail025.png">
            <p>Quickly, the liquids had begun to evaporate in the curry. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail027.png">
            <p>The rice pot also got a lid while we waited for both to be ready. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail028.png">
            <p>By now, the chicken was almost ready. A chunk of chicken was cut in half to check its doneness.</p>
            <img src="thumbnail029.png">
            <p>Finally, the rice was ready! It looked fluffy and delicious. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail035.png">
            <p>It was time to plate the finished dish with snow peas. The liquid part of the curry soaked into the rice and made a sauce for it. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail036.png">
            <p>We dug in, and it was very good! You can see the dish, half-eaten, with the sauce on the rice. </p>
            <img src="thumbnail040.png">
            <p>I finished and took this picture to show my clean plate. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>My family members who ate the dish enjoyed it very much. The curry turned out a little more spicy than my brother would have liked, but he still enjoyed the rest of the dish. </p>
            <br/>
