            <p>Below you can find my "fractured fairy tale", where I took a fairy tale and adapted it to Vietnamese cultural elements. </p>
            <p>It is loosely based on Cinderella, but is quite different in most regards. Enjoy!</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Fractured Fairy Tale</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 28th, 2017</p>

            <p>Abused by her stepmother, Huang Chung, a small girl born to Vietnamese parents, walked the long and winding, creaking, cracked staircase to the dusty attic. She was very small for being 14, but even with her limited weight, the stairs moaned under the pressure. 

              Huang sat in the corner, crying, “What have I done to deserve this?”</p>
	
	<p>Her mother died when she was only two, for reasons unknown to the family, but they all consider her an outlier, being the only member of the family who was directly related to her father, who was never around. 

    Huang Chung continued to cry, pitying herself more than ever this August afternoon. </p>

<p>Her stepsister, Huang Thi, had succeeded in winning the most handsome young man in the village, Ling Roma. They would stroll, pretending they were the only people in the village, past the river and down to the pond, not caring for anyone or anything but themselves. </p>

<p>One day, the stepsister and her lover came home together to meet Huang Chung’s stepmother. Upon seeing Huang Chung, who was much more beautiful than her stepsister, the lover demanded to see her at once. Of course, Huang Thi, considering herself far superior to Huang Chung, yelled at her to go back upstairs before the lover could see her very well, but she was too late.</p>

            <p>“Why do you hate her?”, he asked. </p>
            <p>“She is my terrible half-sister, a disgusting beast who lives in the attic!”</p>
            <p>“But she is much prettier than you”, the lover replied. </p>

<p>Huang Thi was furious. She stomped her feet on the ground and screamed. The lover ran up the stairs to see Huang Chung, and the stairs almost broke under his increased weight. </p>

<p>Huang Chung looked fearfully through her dark hair, which was covering her face. When she saw the smile on the young man’s face, however, she opened up. He lifted her into the air in a graceful dance. Huang Thi ran up the stairs, now completely irate. </p>

            <p>Ling Roma said, “Now you know how your step sister has felt for all of these years”. </p>

<p>Huang Thi couldn’t stand it any longer. She sulked down the stairs and walked to the river. Knowing she could not fight the current, she jumped in, and was swept away. She was never heard from again. </p>

<p>Huang Chung and Ling Roma left the attic and ran over the pond together. They found the adirondack chairs on the bridge and sat and talked. Ling Roma put his arm over Huang Chung’s shoulders, and they discussed all of their hardships. </p>

            <p>The new lovers were happy unto their death fifty years later.</p>
