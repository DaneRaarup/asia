            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 15th, 2017</p>

            <p><b>Strength: </b>Yoko's strength is her ability to learn skills that she would never have foreseen herself using prior to leaving the bamboo grove.</p>

            <p><b>Defining Moment: </b>Her defining moment is when she wins the writing contest to earn money for her sister and herself. </p>
            <p><b>Essential Question: </b>Why is she not more scared to go to the school with the wealthy Japanese girls?</p>

            <p><b>Defining Moment: </b>Yoko and Ko's mother's defining moment is when she safely brings her children into Japan.  </p>
            <p><b>Essential Question: </b>Why did she lose the will to live when her parents were dead, even though her children needed her?</p>

            <p><b>Essential Question: </b>Why did he fall to the social pressure to join the student army (and then get all of the questions wrong), when it almost cost him ever seeing his family again?</p>
            <img src="../../friends.jpg">
              <p><b>Image Meaning: </b>The friends in the image represent Hideyo's relationship with the Korean family that accepted him. </p>
