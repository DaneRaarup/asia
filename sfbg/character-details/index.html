            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Yoko</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 15th, 2017</p>

            <p><b>Strength: </b>Yoko's strength is her ability to learn skills that she would never have foreseen herself using prior to leaving the bamboo grove.</p>
            <p><b>Weakness: </b>Her weakness lies in her introvertedness and how scared she is, especially at the beginning of the book. </p>
            <p><b>Defining Moment: </b>Her defining moment is when she wins the writing contest to earn money for her sister and herself. </p>
            <p><b>Essential Question: </b>Why is she not more scared to go to the school with the wealthy Japanese girls?</p>

            <p><b>Strength: </b>Yoko's mother's strength is her constant desire to protect her children. </p>
            <p><b>Weakness: </b>Her mother's weakness is that she has difficulty finding a reason to stay alive when her parents died in the bombing.</p>
            <p><b>Defining Moment: </b>Yoko and Ko's mother's defining moment is when she safely brings her children into Japan.  </p>
            <p><b>Essential Question: </b>Why did she lose the will to live when her parents were dead, even though her children needed her?</p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 15th, 2017</p>

            <p><b>Strength: </b>Ko's strength is that she can protect Yoko even when their mother dies. </p>
            <p><b>Weakness: </b>Her weakness lies in the fact that she does not understand Yoko's importance. </p>
            <p><b>Defining Moment: </b>Ko's defining moment is when her mother dies and she must be the head of the family.  </p>
            <p><b>Essential Question: </b>Why does she wish Yoko dead and treat Yoko so badly when they needed each other to survive in Japan?</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Hideyo</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 15th, 2017</p>

            <p><b>Strength: </b>His strength is that he wants very badly to see his family again. </p>
            <p><b>Weakness: </b>Hideyo's weakness is that he seemed to want to join the student army, missing his family's departure.  </p>
            <p><b>Defining Moment: </b>His defining moment is when he makes it to the farmhouse and he is accepted as a brother there.  </p>
            <p><b>Essential Question: </b>Why did he fall to the social pressure to join the student army (and then get all of the questions wrong), when it almost cost him ever seeing his family again?</p>

            <p><b>Strength: </b>His strength is that Corporal Matsumura felt the need to see Yoko's family again, and went to great lengths to do so.  </p>
            <p><b>Weakness: </b>The corporal's weakness is that he did not feel the will to live until Yoko saw him for the first time.  </p>
            <p><b>Defining Moment: </b>His defining moment is when he escapes on the log for four days to see the family.  </p>
            <p><b>Essential Question: </b>Why did he suddenly gain the will to live when Yoko promised to dance for him? </p>
