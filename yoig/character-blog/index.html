            <p>Below you will find "blog posts" from the perspective of <em>Year of Impossible Goodbyes</em> characters. You'll see their "opinions" on various matters and lots more. </p>
            <p>Stay tuned, the characters are posting! <p/>

            <p>I feel like I have never felt before. Alone, in a world of people who are both familiar and strange. Attacked personally by Japenese soldiers, who, in fighting the "White Devils", only end up forcing us to fight amongst ourselves. </p>
            <p>They cut Grandfather's tree down, with their magic ability to remove what is most dear to our hearts: hope. They force us to work, to meet our quotas, so that we cannot fight back. We are hopeless.<p/>
            <p>A good quote to emphasize this is the following: <q>I felt like a different person. I felt so many confilcting emotions struggling within me. The world seemed empty. The air was so dark and heavy, I could hardly breathe (Choi 44).</q> Although this quote is after Sookan's grandfather died, it still demonstrates her perspective and outlook very well. </p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 14th, 2017</p>

            <p>Grandfather died. Had they not come to ruin the party, to destroy his tree, and remind him of his days when he was tortured by the Japenese. When I was asked to oil his toes, I learned for the first time exactly <em>how</em> he was tortured: they must have removed his toenails, one by one. </p>
            <p>Mother has been so sad. I know that she and Grandfather had a special relationship. Maybe the Buddha took her soul, too, to keep Grandfather company. It certainly feels like it. The first time she spoke was when Captain Narita wanted to see her. <p/>
            <p>It feels like all that has been good in my life has become bad. </p>
