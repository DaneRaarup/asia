            <p>Below you will find "blog posts" from the perspective of <em>Year of Impossible Goodbyes</em> characters. You'll see their "opinions" on various matters and lots more. </p>
            <p>Stay tuned, the characters are posting! <p/>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 13th, 2017</p>

            <p>I feel like I have never felt before. Alone, in a world of people who are both familiar and strange. Attacked personally by Japenese soldiers, who, in fighting the "White Devils", only end up forcing us to fight amongst ourselves. </p>
            <p>They cut Grandfather's tree down, with their magic ability to remove what is most dear to our hearts: hope. They force us to work, to meet our quotas, so that we cannot fight back. We are hopeless.<p/>
            <p>A good quote to emphasize this is the following: <blockquote>"I felt like a different person. I felt so many confilcting emotions struggling within me. The world seemed empty. The air was so dark and heavy, I could hardly breathe" (Choi 44).</blockquote> Although this quote is after Sookan's grandfather died, it still demonstrates her perspective and outlook very well. </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Post 2 (Sookan's Perspective; Chapters 3 and 4)</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 14th, 2017</p>

            <p>Grandfather died. Had they not come to ruin the party, to destroy his tree, and remind him of his days when he was tortured by the Japenese, he probably would not have died. To know that he could have lived just makes his death more painful for all of us. When I was asked to oil his toes, I learned for the first time exactly <em>how</em> he was tortured: they must have removed his toenails, one by one. </p>
            <p>Mother has been so sad. I know that she and Grandfather had a special relationship. Maybe the Buddha took her soul, too, to keep Grandfather company. It certainly feels like it. The first time she spoke was when Captain Narita wanted to see her. <p/>
            <p>It feels like all that has been good in my life has become bad. </p>
            <p>Another quote that I feel strongly represents her feelings: <blockquote>"I sat in helpless silence and watched the dawn break. The sun rose like any other day. It shone brightly, and I shut my eyes in defiance" (Choi 63). </blockquote> After all that she had gone through: the soldiers, her grandfather, the party, the sock girls taken away, nothing changed in the rest of the world and that seemed cruel to Sookan.  </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Post 3 (Sookan's Perspective; Chapters 5-8)</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 20th, 2017</p>

            <p>Kisa tried to get us out of the Russians' new lair. I believe it with all my heart that he treid his hardest. But, given our notoriously bad luck, of course he chose one of the guides who never followed through, just turned us in to the Russians. I don't know what's going to happen to us. It makes me scared just to think of it. </p>
            <p>Why couldn't the Americans have come to save us? They had always been good friends, before the war and all. They must have decided that it was too difficult to reclaim all of Korea, so they only took over the territory south of the 38th Parallel. That means that we, the Koreans of the North (we don't like the name North Koreans), are left behind with the Communist Russians. <p/>
            <p>I really hope that we'll get our Mother back. She means so much to us. It seemed that the Russian soldier tried to help, but he knew that he would be prosecuted for disobediance if he helped. </p>
            <p>A good quote: <blockquote>"She couldn't bear to tell us last night that the guide we hired was a double agent. He regularly informed the soldiers about his catch and they paid him a fee" (Choi 136). </blockquote>This is when Sookan finally realizes how bad things have gotten. </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Post 4 (Sookan's Perspective; Chapters 9-10)</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 20th, 2017</p>

            <p>I feel different. I am not just the girl I was when we lived Pyongyang. I am now a woman. I am almost Inchun's mother, now that we are motherless.</p>
            <p>We have been forced to work like adults. Caring for children to earn ears of corn, what little food the merchants had left over. <p/>
            <p>Inchun has changed, too. He is now a little wise old man. He certainly still looks up to his <em>nuna</em>, but he has begun to see us differently. </p>
             <p>A quote representing this change: <blockquote>"It was hard to be a <em>nuna</em>. I wished someone older than I were around" (Choi 153). </blockquote>This quote describes the extent to which the new responsibility was taking a toll on Sookan, and it showed her connection to Inchun. </p>
