            <p>Below you will find "blog posts" from the perspective of <em>Year of Impossible Goodbyes</em> characters. You'll see their "opinions" on various matters and lots more. </p>
            <p>Stay tuned, the fictional characters are posting! <p/>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 13th, 2017</p>

            <p>I feel like I have never felt before. Alone, in a world of people who are both familiar and strange. Attacked personally by Japenese soldiers, who, in fighting the "White Devils", only end up forcing us to fight amongst ourselves. </p>
            <p>They cut Grandfather's tree down, with their magic ability to remove what is most dear to our hearts: hope. They force us to work, to meet our quotas, so that we cannot fight back. We are hopeless.<p/>
            <p>A good quote to emphasize this is the following: "I felt like a different person. I felt so many confilcting emotions struggling within me. The world seemed empty. The air was so dark and heavy, I could hardly breathe" (Choi 44). Although this quote is after Sookan's grandfather died, it still demonstrates her perspective and outlook very well. </p>
