            <p>As I learn about <em>Year of Impossible Goodbyes</em> characters, I will post some interesting character details on this page.</p>
            <p>This will be completed soon. <p/>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Grandfather</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 17th, 2017</p>

            <p><b>Strength: </b>Grandfather's strength lies in his willingness to rebel against the Japense after his rough experiences with them in the past.</p>
            <p><b>Weakness: </b>Grandfather lost his will to live, even though freedom (at least from the Japenese) was months away. Had he kept his will to live, even in the face of his tree being cut down, he could have died much happier.</p>
            <p><b>Defining Moment: </b>His defining moment is when his tree is cut down and he finally loses his will to live. He declares that he will not want his shoes again, which implies that he sees himself dying very soon after.</p>
            <p><b>Essential Question: </b>Why did Grandfather want his grandchildren to know the truth about his past and his feet even though Mother obviously did not? </p>
            <img src="../../Orange_hour_in_village.jpg">
          <p><b>Image Meaning: </b>The old barn at sunset represents Grandfather's last days.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Aunt Tiger</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 20th, 2017</p>

            <p><b>Strength: </b>Aunt Tiger's greatest strength is her ability to sacrifice herself for the "greater good". </p>
            <p><b>Weakness: </b>Aunt Tiger misses her husband so much that she cannot bring herself to leave when the Russians are making it harder and harder to escape to the South. </p>
            <p><b>Defining Moment: </b>Her defining moment is when she makes the decision to stay behind with Kisa even though Sookan, Inchun, Mother, and the "guide" leave to escape to the South. </p>
            <p><b>Essential Question: </b>Why did Aunt Tiger become a "devoted Town Red", when the change made it obvious that her family was planning something?</p>
