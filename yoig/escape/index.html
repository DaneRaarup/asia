            <p>I watched videos about the experiences of people who have escaped from North Korea and my questions and comments on the videos are below.</p>
            <p>I was absent for the first video, so my questions and comments are not posted here.<p/>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 14th, 2017</p>

            <p>The video I watched was titled "Escape from North Korea" and it was a TED talk. </p>
            <p>My questions and comments are as follows: <p/>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>How was that the first experience when she had heard of poverty in her country was when she was seven years old?</li>
                <li>Why did the 1990s famine in North Korea hit? What caused it? Was it directly related to the new lack of support from the Soviet Union?</li>
                <li>There is so much death, from famine and attempted escape mentioned in the video. </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
