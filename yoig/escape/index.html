            <p>I watched videos about the experiences of people who have escaped from North Korea and my questions and comments on the videos are below.</p>
            <p>I was absent for the first video, so my questions and comments are not posted here.<p/>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 14th, 2017</p>

            <p>The video I watched was titled "Escape from North Korea" and it was a TED talk. </p>
            <p>My questions and comments are as follows: <p/>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>How was that the first experience when she had heard of poverty in her country was when she was seven years old?</li>
                <li>Why did the 1990s famine in North Korea hit? What caused it? Was it directly related to the new lack of support from the Soviet Union?</li>
                <li>There is so much death, from famine and attempted escape mentioned in the video. </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>This video, from Mashable Docs, is actually about escaping from Syria. </p>
            <p>My questions and comments are as follows: <p/>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>I am surprised that civilians are in danger as much as they are in Syria. </li>
                <li>Is there no "normal" person in Syria whose home or workplace or school is not targeted for bombings? </li>
                <li>I find it impressive that they were able to escape and now live a life that is normal for the United States.  </li>
              </ul>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 16th, 2017</p>

            <p>These people have escaped from Burma (now Myanmar), and tell their story in this video by the Globe and Mail.  </p>
            <p>My questions and comments are as follows: <p/>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Was there a reason other than racial segregation that the Burmese government prohibited these students from attending school? </li>
                <li>What was life like in Burma prior to the escape? </li>
                <li>It's crazy how much they have improved in their schoolwork from the teacher's description. </li>
                <li>Why are they hated and targeted by the government of Burma? </li>
                <li>I find it sad that the vast majority of the people who escaped on the boat that Mohammed was on died. </li>
              </ul>
